__Garbage collection__ is like if in basketball, coaches can substitute players by simply introducing the new player into play but the replaced player can remain on the court. You assume they won't move or touch the ball or interfere with other players. And then every 5 minutes, the referees yell "FREEZE!" to check every player and sit out the ones that were substituted.
