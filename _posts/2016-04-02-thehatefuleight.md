* In typical Tarantino style, suspenseful dialogue stretches tensions in Hateful Eight until it snaps in the most violent fashion.
* 2 bounty hunters, a captured outlaw, and a sheriff find themselves snowed in a wooden cabin with a seemingly boring group of travelers. As the snow storm progresses, we learn that everyone's true identities are buried deep as their facades start melting away.
* I struggled to find what era of movies or story-telling that Hateful Eight was a testament to, a common attribute of Tarantino films. And I'm not saying this is what makes this a good or bad movie. It's me playing Tarantino's game. I looked it up after the movie was over and I recommend everyone to look it up themselves. I believe this film is unique from other Tarantino films because the testament is not to a visual style of a certain era but more a historic interpretation of the progression of events of history.
* The most standout hallmark of this movie is the dialogue. The "whodunnit?" situation in the movie presents itself very similar to a game of Clue but the movie does not fall into a trap of submitting viewers to a timeline of process of elimination (_"It could'nt have been the Colonel with the Candle in the Library! So who's left?"_). The predicament is a swirling stew of hidden identities, unknown motives, and untold pasts coming to a violent boil. Characters constantly poke and test eachothers' identities using the confines of the cabin. Tasks like bringing the horses to the stable or making coffee become oppurtunities to learn more about the other housemates.
* The movie is entertaining but it lacks a memorable moments compared to Tarantino's other movies.
* _"Hey! Close the door! You gotta nail it down! 2 nails! You gotta use 2 nails!"_
* 7/10
