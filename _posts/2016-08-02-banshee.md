* insanely violent and corny
* The show follows a released convict who's catching up to his past.
  * Immediately in the first episode, the viewer learns that the convict is chasing an old-love. Turns out that she was an accomplice. He is a former master thief.
* The show's choice of adding surprise and cliffhangers? "X" is related to "Y".
* I honestly think the show is marketed towards fans of UFC.
  * "[Lucas Hood](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102278/?ref_=tt_cl_t1)" really learned to fight when he was in jail.
  * And he always seems to end up in hand-to-hand and/or melee combat.
  * And damn, it always end in the most violent ways.
* All the lines are really corny.
* The most refreshing character is [Hoon Lee's](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1229640/?ref_=tt_cl_t6) character who is a transgender, criminal hacker with a lot of wit thrown out with a Southern accent.
* 3/10
