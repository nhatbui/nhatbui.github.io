Are you setting up a host with multicast DNS (mDNS) on Ubuntu Core?

There are some posts out there [1](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap/issues/176) [2](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/snapcraft/2017-January/002709.html) [3](https://askubuntu.com/questions/853134/avahi-samba-on-snappy-core-16-04-arm) about people trying to get mDNS on their Ubuntu Core.
But [avahi-daemon is now available as a snap for Ubuntu core](https://uappexplorer.com/snap/ubuntu/avahi).
