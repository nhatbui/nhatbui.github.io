* I never really watched Seinfield but I love Larry David's show _Curb Your Enthusiasm_.
* Larry plays a semi-fictional version of himself. Basically the show consists of Larry walking around LA in baggy clothes and finding himself at the center of everyone's problems.
  * Some issues are a result of Larry's good intentions. Most are a result of Larry's seemingly unending grumpiness or annoyance of all things petty.
  * But what makes viewers empathetic towards Larry is that he actually cares about the people around him.
  * In the most recent episode to my memory, Larry visits a masseuse recommended by his friend [Jeff Green](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0023722/?ref_=tt_cl_t2) (played by Jeff Garlin). Larry ends the massage when the masseuse goes a little too far and after confronting Jeff about the unexpected unhappy ending of the massage referral, Larry decides not to tell his remarkably patient TV-wife Cheryl David, played by [Cheryl Hines](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0023721/?ref_=tt_cl_t3), because he "stopped it". However, Larry once again finds himself in trouble when Cheryl confronts the masseuse after being tipped off by her fortune teller.
* By far my favorite thing is when Larry is in his own world and the only view we get into this world is [in tongues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9DKjOUi2g8) or [a sweet melody](https://youtu.be/Y0WwfTAUKMc?t=12s).
* 9/10
