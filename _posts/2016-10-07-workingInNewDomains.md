As a data scientist, you may have domain expertise but sometimes
you'll find that your strong foundations in math, stats, machine learning, and computer science
are needed on another project in your company. You may be a image processing guru
but another manager would like to have you explore some NLP applications. So
how should you approach a new __domain__?

Well you conclude, logically of course, that you know the basics, the machine
learning, the libraries, the language to prototype with, the bread and
butter, and that you just need to apply it to this new domain. You may do something
basic to start off with. Some simple feature extraction and pipe it through one of
the classic algorithms (SVM, K-means, etc.). But I think __the best place to start
is to implement a paper in that domain.__

It won't be easy but it'll save time. A good paper should essentially outline everything
you need to do at a high level. All you need to do is implement it yourself (again,
  not saying it will be easy but at least you have _direction_.). And if you pick
a recent paper, your work will reflect the latest, state-of-the-art research in
that domain. Find the terms that are used in your domain that describe what you
are trying to do i.e. identifying where text is in an image? _Text detection_.
Transcribing what the text actually says? _Text recognition_. Now search them on
[arxiv](arxiv.org) or [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com) and see what comes up!
