* I have never seen a Melissa McCarthy and I gotta say that I liked this movie.
* There are scenes that you can tell are improv and Melissa develops a good banter with other characters.
  * The scene with Kristen Bell getting ready for her date.
  * All scenes where she crashes the Dandelions meetings.
* Summary: Melissa McCarthy is a red-headed, enterprising Nancy Grace lookalike whose fall from grace leads to a new
 redeeming business venture involves really delicious brownies made by Kristen Bell.
* All characters are pretty refreshing for an almost-summer comedy.
  * Kristen Bell's office boyfriend is a charming jokester in the same-style of Jason Segel.
    * I still don't like Jason Segel.
  * Kristen's daugher is funny. And always somehow catches all the inappropriate bits of adult conversations.
  * The power mom and the Dandelion scout-master (? is that what they're called) has some of my favorite scenes.
  * Peter Dinklage plays a spiteful ex-boyfriend who is also has a samurai fandom.
* Not a revolutionary comedy but it's great for a few solid laughs.
* 6/10
