* The movie that finally pays attention to the collateral damage surrounding Superman's action.
  * The movie should've ended right at the bathtub scene.
    * Lois, played by Amy Adams, is in the bathroom taking a bath after a difficult day at work where she was captured
    by terrorists. Superman had saved her but while doing so, has hurt many innocent lives.
    * Superman, appearing as Clark Kent and played by Henry "Hair Never Moves" Cavill, appears in the bathroom with
    flowers.
    * Lois expresses concern over the events that has happened and the increasing negativity associated with Superman.
    * Superman comforts her and in an act of desperate intimacy, climbs into the tub with his clothes on. His body's
    volume displaces water in the tub, so much so it spills over.
    * DONE. Though having the best intentions, SUPERMAN ONCE AGAIN RUINS SOMETHING. Do you know what kind of mold this
    will bring?! Damp bathrooms are a haven for mold because of the wet conditions. Superman just exacerbated the
    situation. Lois probably has those midcentury homes too with the wood floors and trim. Those are highly susceptible
    to mold.
* Lex Luthor plays the CEO of a startup, LexCorp, trying to pivot from software to hardware after hearing that Y
Combinator will focus on more hardware startups.
* At one point, you can see Batman download stolen LexCorp files into the /var/ directory. Batman uses Linux confirmed.
* Upon extracting LexCorp files, he opens it and it goes immediately to LexOS. Batman uses Docker confirmed.
* Batman's heavy-armour suit looks like King Arthur on steroids.
  * Batman's heavy-armour suit looks like he ate King Arther.
    * Batman's heavy-armour suit will be part of the downloadable-content in the newest Call of Duty: Modern Batfare.
      * Batman's heavy-armour suit looks like the RoboCop from Medieval Times.
* In an act of desperation to appeal to investors, Lex from LexCorp releases an actual organic, living AI Assistant.
It's UX has been described as brute because it responds with "grr" and "rawr". Users mostly describe it's appearance
similar to the main Orc from Lord of The Rings.
  * ...the Rancor from Return of the Jedi
    * ...a Shrek-like ogre from the bad side of the Swamp.
* Superman dies from being impaled by the Harry Potter troll's ingrown fingernail.
* At one point, the movie tries to generate hype for the next installment of superhero
    movies by teasing which heroes may make an appearance. Gal Gadot is on a laptop
    clicking on LexCorp "files" which consist of collected evidence revealing individuals
    with super powers. You see The Flash and one other super hero that I don't know but
    looks like a cyborg. BUT MY FAVORITE PART is when they show Aquaman. A submarine is exploring
    a shipwreck and Aquaman just happens to be alone inside the shipwreck. Doing. Absolutely.
    Nothing. The Lord of the Ocean is in his domain and all of its creatures will bend to its
    will and he's just swimming around in a shipwreck!
* 5/10
