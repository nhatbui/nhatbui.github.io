* 3-word summary: Dinosaur Gladiatorial Wrestlemania.
  *  Crowd-pleasing action with a bow on top.
* Allow me to summarize the end without actually spoiling it for you: It's like as if [Batman vs. Superman ends with Aquaman coming out of the water to grab Superman back to the depths of his ocean lair.]("http://i.imgur.com/hvNOMLw.gifv")
* It's a good reminder how Speilberg was able to capture the pure awe of seeing a living dinosaur in the original movie.
    * This time around, it's like we have the dinosaur riding a [tiny bicycle for a circus.]("https://youtu.be/yfIqxBbWnpA?t=8m5s")
        * I know what they're trying to convey. We got to the point where we aren't even afraid of the dinosaurs we've create (or recreated?). In fact, we're embracing it. We made it into entertainment. But it's just too fantastical. It's not believable.
        * It's doesn't have the rawness of the original.
* In the ultimate act of jumping-the-shark, JP3 predicts dinosaur soldiers.
  * More like jumping-the-Megalodon.
* It could be said that it's a commentary on the possible future of genetics. But the entertainment feels really cheesy.
* 5/10
